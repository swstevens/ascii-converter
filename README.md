# ascii-converter

Personal project to apply ASCII art conversion algorithms. The goal of this project is to work through a variety of mediums to see what I can do personally with ascii art. 
Planned parts are:
1. 2D image conversion
2. 2D image with smoothing/averaging
3. 3D render conversion to 2D
